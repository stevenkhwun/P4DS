    "## Summary\n",
    "Congratulations! You're ready to move on to your next lesson! \n",
    "In this lab, you learned how to implement and assess the performance of classification models using real-world data. You explored different evaluation metrics and the confusion matrix to understand how well your models performed. By working with the breast cancer data set, you created two classification models to predict whether a mass is benign or malignant. Additionally, you simulated measurement errors by adding Gaussian random noise to the features and then evaluated the impact on your model's performance.\n",
